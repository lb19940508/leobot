Hello, I'm Leo. I've always been wanting to have a place to host my words, as my digital garden. Here, after endless try and error, finally I got this one.

In this web page, you could see my thoughts  I've been developing while I learning and consuming stuff.

## What am I trying to to?
- I really like [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md), a note editor. It's really smooth using it.
- The publish function is also wanted, but it's too expensive for me too use it since it is 100$/year.
- Luckily I found quarz, a relatively applicable way for both editing and publishing. Credit to the author JackyZhao.
- Wish to grow this website bigger.
- Let's see how far I can go with it.

Special thanks to [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening).
