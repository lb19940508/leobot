Special thanks to [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening).

## What am I trying to to?
- I really like [Obsidian](notes/quarz_original/obsidian.md), a note editor. It's really smooth using it.
- The publish function is also wanted, but it's too expensive for me too use it since it is 100$/year.
- Luckily I found quarz, a relatively applicable way for both editing and publishing. Credit to the author JackyZhao.
- Wish to grow this website bigger.
- Let's see how far I can go with it.
- Now let's try some links like this: [test_note](test_note.md)
- also [test2](notes/quarz_original/test2.md)

## Why Quartz?
Hosting a public digital garden isn't easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/), and [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), yet none of them have super easy to use *free* tools to publish that garden to the world.

I've personally found that 
1. It's nice to access notes from anywhere
2. Having a public digital garden invites open conversations
3. It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge *playful and fun*

> “He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.” — Richard Hamming

I was really inspired by [Bianca](https://garden.bianca.digital/) and [Joel](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)'s digital gardens and wanted to try making my own.

**The goal of Quartz is to make hosting your own public digital garden free and simple.** You don't even need your own website. Quartz does all of that for you and gives your own little corner of the internet.

## Get Started
The entire Quartz documentation is fully hosted using Quartz! To get started, let's visit the main directory.
