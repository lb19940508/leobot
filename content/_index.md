一直以来，其实都想有一个属于自己的地方，可以写一写自己的想法，记录下自己学到的有价值的东西。尝试了许久之后终于搭好了这个网站，希望可以长久的运作下去。

Hello, I'm Leo. I've always been wanting to have a place to host my notes, as my digital garden. Here, after endless try and error, finally I got this one.

In this website, you could see my thoughts  I've been developing while I learning and consuming stuff. Hope you could enjoy it.

## What am I trying to to?
- I really like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a note editor. It's really smooth using it. The publish function of it is also amazing, but it's too expensive for me too use it since it is nearly 100$ per year.
- Luckily I found Quarz, a relatively applicable way for both editing and publishing. Credit to the author JackyZhao.
- Wish to grow this website bigger. Let's see how far I can go with it.
