-   Just like people who were struck down during COVID-19 pandemic, people died from the Spanish Flu were mostly marginal communities. They were predominantly immigrants by then. Who will remember minnows like these outcasts?
-   If there were some famous people died from the Spanish Flu, it might have become the collective memory. But according to the record, rarely any men in authority died from it, that maybe the main reason why it is not in the public discourse.
-   Oklahoma was influenced greatly by then, and is one of the state dealing with the COVID-19 spike with the least compliance of masking by now. "Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it.", one said in his letter to Scientific American.
