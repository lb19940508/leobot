title: "How Science Explain Trump's Grip on White Male"
---
-   Recently, a group of insurrectionists vandalized the Capitol in Washington D.C.， mostly White male supporters of Trump. They scaled the walls, hanged from the balconies and smashed windows.
-   No shortage of pundits and prognosticators speculated the underlying reasons for it.
-   A research in 1994 found that white male and white female differed in the facet of risk perception. White male tend to perceive the risk much less than the female in areas like racism, gender and nuclear issues, etc. But there was no such difference between male and female of other races.
-   Another study in 2007 dived into the White male effect in a cultural background, that at a fundamental level, linked to socioeconomic status, attitude toward community and egalitarianism.
-   So this helps explain why white male tend to do this: they perceived an even greater crisis in the horizon, the elevation of social status, one which inevitably linked to race, gender and religion. And deem Trump as the only one who could preserve and restore the situation.
