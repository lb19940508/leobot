-   start off at somewhere they can understand 从听众会的地方开始
    -   before explaining, try to ask question about their basic knowledge
    -   start from the knowledge they understand
    -   when explaining, ask "does it make any sense" to keep them up with you
-   don't dive too deep into the rabbit hole 不需要钻的太过深入
    -   only give them several points to make sure they are intrigued, rather than give a whole load of things.
-   clarity beats accuracy 让听众有清楚的理解比精准的解释更重要
    -   an accurate explanation maybe too long and uninteresting
    -   use examples they understand to make them retain a good understand and curiosity of the thing, and get away with it
-   explain why it's cool **解释下为什么它很有意思**
    -   tell people why it makes you excited
