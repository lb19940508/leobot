title: "Astronomer Avi Loeb Claims That Extraterrestials Have Visited the Earth"
---
-   Background:
    -   Several months ago, an abnormal space object, Oumuamua, flew over the Earth. It doesn't share the most common properties as found previously on other space objects.
    -   Oumuamua is a tube-like or pancake-like object.
    -   Its reflective rate is almost 10 times higher than other space rocks or asteroids, meaning its surface is perhaps just as shiny as burnished metal.
    -   And also, a queer acceleration of Oumuamua is detected after swooping by the sun.
-   Controversy:
    -   Some scientists suggest that these abnormality could be explained within the natural phenomenon spectrum. However, astronomer Avi Loeb argues that, these findings may indicate that we were just visited by the aliens.
    -   Because, first, scientists have not found any tube-like space object like Oumuamua. It may indicate that it's part of interstellar rocket forsaken very long time ago.
    -   Second, as for its reflective rate, natural space objects hitherto found by astronomers are not as high as that, which may suggest that Oumuamua is an artifact.
    -   Third, some people tend to illuminate its abrupt zooming as the outcome of jetting caused by vaporization of ice on its surface when it was lighted by the sun. But normally, a comet-tail-like trace would be found when it's jetting. However, nothing was there, which hint that either the ice on it is so pure that it does not contain any small mineral particles, or it's an artificial object which was driven by **light sail**, a kind of emerging space-propelled technology the author is working on.
-   Why finding extraterrestrials is as important as string theory?
    -   The author believes that the string theory and multiverse theory could not be vindicated, while finding extraterrestrials can. It's actually knowledge based experiment. Propose a theory and then observe the fact to test the theory. It's just as simple as that.
-   Is the author aiming at promoting himself?
    -   The author argues that the reason for his closeness to the media is not for selling books. Instead, it's for the aim of getting more and more people exposed to his opinion on this area, that we should invest more to find extraterrestrials.
-   What would be considered a normal comment as the author implied?
    -   The author considers a comment with reasoning and clear arguments as normal comments and could be considered acceptable, rather than just nasty words.
-   Is the author trying to curry favor with his benefactor Yuri?
    -   He admitted that his idea of _light sail_ on Oumuamua may due to his former work related to this area. But he also expressed that what he does is totally out of his own curiosity. If he wants to get approval from his benefactor Yuri, he has every reason to go to him directly.
