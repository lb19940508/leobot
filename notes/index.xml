Why Quartz? Hosting a public digital garden isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. There are an overwhelming number of tutorials, resources, and guides for tools like Notion , Roam , and Obsidian , yet none of them have super easy to use free tools to publish that garden to the world.
I&amp;rsquo;ve personally found that
It&amp;rsquo;s nice to access notes from anywhere Having a public digital garden invites open conversations It makes keeping personal notes and knowledge playful and fun “He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important.</description></item><item><title>Astronomer Avi Loeb Claims That Extraterrestials Have Visited the Earth</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/Astronomer-Avi-Loeb-Claims-That-Extraterrestials-Have-Visited-the-Earth/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/Astronomer-Avi-Loeb-Claims-That-Extraterrestials-Have-Visited-the-Earth/</guid><description>Background: Several months ago, an abnormal space object, Oumuamua, flew over the Earth. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t share the most common properties as found previously on other space objects. Oumuamua is a tube-like or pancake-like object. Its reflective rate is almost 10 times higher than other space rocks or asteroids, meaning its surface is perhaps just as shiny as burnished metal. And also, a queer acceleration of Oumuamua is detected after swooping by the sun.</description></item><item><title>Chronic Kidney Disease</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/Chronic-Kidney-Disease/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/Chronic-Kidney-Disease/</guid><description>Background: A third of Americans are at risk of Chronic kidney disease, and age is one of the major factor. Over a half of Americans older than 75, are believed to have some sort of kidney damage. Shape: Kidneys are two bean-like organs that sit just below rib cage near the spine. Functionality: It keeps balance of potassium, sodium and other minerals in the body fluid, and expels waste as urine out of the body.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/config/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/config/</guid><description>Configuration Quartz is designed to be extremely configurable. You can find the bulk of the configuration scattered throughout the repository depending on how in-depth you&amp;rsquo;d like to get.
The majority of configuration can be be found under data/config.yaml. An annotated example configuration is shown below.

All of the three members were administered with their first shot of the Coronavirus vaccine. In fact, after 12 days of their first shot, people would have developed their early protection. But only after a week or two of their second shot, could they be considered as fully vaccinated.</description></item><item><title>Deploying Quartz to the Web</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/hosting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/hosting/</guid><description>GitHub Pages Quartz is designed to be effortless to deploy. If you forked and cloned Quartz directly from the repository, everything should already be good to go! You can head to &amp;lt;YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/quartz to see it live.

Obsidian I strongly recommend using Obsidian as a way to edit and grow your digital garden. It comes with a really nice editor and graphical interface to preview all of my local files.

Of course, all the files are in Markdown so you could just use your favourite text editor of choice.</description></item><item><title>External Hosting</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/external-hosting/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/external-hosting/</guid><description/></item><item><title>How Science Explain Trump's Grip on White Male</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/How-Science-Explain-Trumps-Grip-on-White-Male/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/How-Science-Explain-Trumps-Grip-on-White-Male/</guid><description>Recently, a group of insurrectionists vandalized the Capitol in Washington D.C.， mostly White male supporters of Trump. They scaled the walls, hanged from the balconies and smashed windows. No shortage of pundits and prognosticators speculated the underlying reasons for it. A research in 1994 found that white male and white female differed in the facet of risk perception. White male tend to perceive the risk much less than the female in areas like racism, gender and nuclear issues, etc.</description></item><item><title>If-You've-Been-Working-From-Home-Please-Wait-For-A-Vaccine</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/If-Youve-Been-Working-From-Home-Please-Wait-For-A-Vaccine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/If-Youve-Been-Working-From-Home-Please-Wait-For-A-Vaccine/</guid><description>If we have been working from home, that means we have already in some way been protected. So we are not those who need vaccines urgently. For our working from home, thousands of others have given up their chances of staying at home. The polices, caretakers, people working for postal services, doctors and nurses, those are the ones that are so venerable and need the doses so desperately. Therefore, if we are already at home, we should not be prioritized to get the shot before these people.</description></item><item><title>Ignoring Notes</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/ignore-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/ignore-notes/</guid><description>Quartz Ignore Edit ignoreFiles in config.toml to include paths you&amp;rsquo;d like to exclude from being rendered.

And patients sometimes are disbelieved. So the doctors just gave some kind explanations to the patients, like insomnia, fatigue, etc to reassure them. Doctors, with extremely tension and fatigue, especially those who have experienced the ICU, after intermittently waves of infections, are tend to give such diagnosis.</description></item><item><title>More COVID variants are appearing</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/More-COVID-variants-are-appearing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/More-COVID-variants-are-appearing/</guid><description>SARS-COV-2 appeared to be mutating in many different regions around the world. They are believed to have appeared independently. However, it seems that they have mutated to the similar direction. It might not be a coincidence. Many mutants are indeed more transmissible than its original version, some even outcompeted the existing variant and become more lethal. They either evolved to better bind to the cell&amp;rsquo;s receptor, or to better evade human&amp;rsquo;s immune system, the antibodies, specifically.</description></item><item><title>Mosquito Has a Needle-like Proboscis</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/Mosquito-Has-a-Needle-like-Proboscis/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/Mosquito-Has-a-Needle-like-Proboscis/</guid><description>Scientists find that mosquito has proboscis that uncannily resembles a syringe tip. When we invented the subcutaneous injection to inject a pellet of medicine with a clunky darning needle, and deem it as cutting-edge technology, mosquitoes have been using this mechanism for millions of years. It&amp;rsquo;s proboscis has a Swiss Army Knife appendage with six instruments, of which five are dedicated to saw into the skin, push open a hole and drop saliva to make the blood drinkable, and one, which is named labrum, is for funneling the blood out.</description></item><item><title>Obsidian Vault Integration</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/obsidian/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/obsidian/</guid><description>Setup Obsidian is the preferred way to use Quartz. You can either create a new Obsidian Vault or link one that your already have.
New Vault If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an existing Vault, download Obsidian and create a new Vault in the /content folder that you created and cloned during the setup .
Linking an existing Vault The easiest way to use an existing Vault is to copy all of our files (directory and hierarchies intact) into the /content folder.</description></item><item><title>Preview Changes</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/preview-changes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/quarz_original/preview-changes/</guid><description>If you&amp;rsquo;d like to preview what your Quartz site looks like before deploying it to the internet, here&amp;rsquo;s exactly how to do that!

They were predominantly immigrants by then. Who will remember minnows like these outcasts? If there were some famous people died from the Spanish Flu, it might have become the collective memory. But according to the record, rarely any men in authority died from it, that maybe the main reason why it is not in the public discourse.</description></item><item><title>做科普的四条原则</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/%E5%81%9A%E7%A7%91%E6%99%AE%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9B%E6%9D%A1%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/%E5%81%9A%E7%A7%91%E6%99%AE%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%9B%E6%9D%A1%E5%8E%9F%E5%88%99/</guid><description>Ref: Quantum Physics for 7 Year Olds | Dominic Walliman | TEDxEastVan start off at somewhere they can understand 从听众会的地方开始 before explaining, try to ask question about their basic knowledge start from the knowledge they understand when explaining, ask &amp;ldquo;does it make any sense&amp;rdquo; to keep them up with you don&amp;rsquo;t dive too deep into the rabbit hole 不需要钻的太过深入 only give them several points to make sure they are intrigued, rather than give a whole load of things.</description></item><item><title>如何像定位笔记一样找到癌细胞？</title><link>https://leobot.cn/notes/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%83%8F%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%E4%B8%80%E6%A0%B7%E6%89%BE%E5%88%B0%E7%99%8C%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://leobot.cn/notes/%E5%A6%82%E4%BD%95%E5%83%8F%E5%AE%9A%E4%BD%8D%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0%E4%B8%80%E6%A0%B7%E6%89%BE%E5%88%B0%E7%99%8C%E7%BB%86%E8%83%9E/</guid><description> One frontier of cancer treatment is the research on bispecific and trispecific antibody. The engineered antibody combine to two or three sites on the exterior of the cancer cell&amp;rsquo;s membrane, as opposed one. Most commonly, it helps bring the immune cells to the proximity of cancer cells, and renders the patient&amp;rsquo;s immune system. For now, only one bispecific treatment is approved for lymphoblastic leukemia. 与以往单特异性抗体不同的是，当前治疗癌症的一个前沿研究是利用被编辑过的双特异性或者三特异性抗体，来结合癌细胞表面的多个靶点。 另外也便于将免疫细胞带到癌细胞的附近，以激发病人本身的免疫系统。当前仅有一种双特异性抗体被批准用于治疗淋巴母细胞型白血病。</description></item></channel></rss>
